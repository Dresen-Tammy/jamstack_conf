# Angular in the Jamstack: From "i dunno" 🤷🏻‍♀️ to pro 💁🏻‍♀️!

Welcome to the workshop! The Jamstack is a fairly new concept that is getting a lot of buzz because people using it are seeing great improvements in site speed and development experience. I could go on about it...and that's exactly what I'll do in this workshop. You're welcome.

This workshop will thoroughly review the main methods and best practices of the Jamstack while we code out an enterprise-level site. The goal is to make you comfortable enough with the Jamstack that you can explain to the rest of your team.

Angular has recently been making its debut into the Jamstack ecosystem. These two technologies bring so much to each other. Of course, I don't need to tell you the greatness of Angular but we will cover this budding relationship later on in further detail.

## The Workshop Agenda

Each section of the workshop will cover an aspect of creating a Jamstack application with Angular. In each directory we'll look into the Jamstack strategy and best practice. After that will be a step-by-step walk-through so we can put these ideas into practice.
