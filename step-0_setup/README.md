# 🛠 Set Up Guide & Pre-Workshop Resources 📓

Well hello there! If you're here it means we get to meet either virtually or IRL real soon. I'm looking forward to it.

In order to get the most out of this workshop we need to hit the ground coding, so I've made a prep sheet for you. Feel free to reach out to me via email at tara [@] netlify [dot] com 👍.
